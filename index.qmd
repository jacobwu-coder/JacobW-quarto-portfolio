# Welcome to My Portfolio! 📊

Hello! My nickname is JacobW. This is my Quarto data visualization portfolio showcasing my Python and matplotlib skills.

## About This Portfolio

This portfolio demonstrates how Quarto can seamlessly integrate Python code and visualizations into professional documents. Each chart below is created using matplotlib and embedded directly into this document.

## Simple Line Chart

Let's create a simple line chart showing some sample data:

```{python}
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np

# Create sample data
x = np.linspace(0, 10, 100)
y = np.sin(x)

# Create the plot
plt.figure(figsize=(7, 4.75))
plt.plot(x, y, 'b-', linewidth=2, label='sin(x)')
plt.xlabel('X values')
plt.ylabel('Y values')
plt.title('My First Matplotlib Chart')
plt.grid(True, alpha=0.3)
plt.legend()
plt.show()
```

## Bar Chart Example

Here's a bar chart showing some sample data:

```{python}
# Sample data for bar chart
categories = ['A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E']
values = [23, 45, 56, 78, 32]

plt.figure(figsize=(7, 4.75))
bars = plt.bar(categories, values, color=['red', 'green', 'blue', 'orange', 'purple'])
plt.xlabel('Categories')
plt.ylabel('Values')
plt.title('Sample Bar Chart')

# Add value labels on bars
for bar, value in zip(bars, values):
    plt.text(bar.get_x() + bar.get_width()/2, bar.get_height() + 1, 
             str(value), ha='center', va='bottom')

plt.show()
```

## Scatter Plot Example

A scatter plot with random data points:

```{python}
# Generate random data for scatter plot
np.random.seed(42)
n_points = 80
x_rand = np.random.randn(n_points) * 2 + 5
y_rand = 2 * x_rand + np.random.randn(n_points) * 3

plt.figure(figsize=(7, 4.75))
plt.scatter(x_rand, y_rand, c=np.arange(n_points), cmap='viridis', alpha=0.7, s=50)
plt.xlabel('X values')
plt.ylabel('Y values')
plt.title('Random Data Scatter Plot')
plt.colorbar(label='Point index')
plt.grid(True, alpha=0.3)
plt.show()
```


## Example: include image from funStuff submodule

If funStuff produces images, you can reference them directly from the submodule path. Example (replace with actual file path):

![](external/funStuff/path/to/image.png){fig-alt="Example plot from funStuff"}

## Conclusion

This demonstrates how Quarto can seamlessly integrate Python code and visualizations into professional documents that can be hosted publicly on GitHub Pages!

## Gallery: funStuffs outputs

A small gallery of outputs from funStuffs (click images to open full size):

```{=html}
<div class="gallery" style="display:flex;gap:1rem;flex-wrap:wrap;">
```

```{python}
from pathlib import Path
import html
imgs = sorted(Path('external/funStuff/plots').glob('*.png'))
for img in imgs:
    print(f'<a href="{img.as_posix()}" target="_blank"><img src="{img.as_posix()}" alt="{html.escape(img.name)}" style="max-width:240px;height:auto;border:1px solid #ddd;padding:4px;border-radius:4px;"></a>')
```

```{=html}
</div>
```

## About Jacob

I am a UD FSAN student (M.S. in Financial Services Analytics) currently expanding my data science and visualization skills. I have 28 years of experience in Telecom and IT — starting as a developer and later focusing on program management and solution sales for the past 20 years. I've had the privilege of visiting more than 30 countries worldwide.

Family & Interests: my daughter and son both play ice hockey; my son plays with the UD Jr. Blue Hens club. I am also a fan of the U.S. Figure Skating team. I practice Stoic philosophy in daily life and reflect those values in my work and learning. We have a Weimaraner named Diamond — I walk him about 2 hours per day.

Why funStuffs: I use this funStuffs playground to record and showcase what I'm learning outside the FSAN program — small projects, experiments, and utilities that help me practice coding, data visualization, and reproducible work.

- Stoicism image and a representative portrait for "a 50-year-old man practicing Stoicism" are shown below as examples.

**About funStuffs**

funStuffs is a playground for small coding projects (AI-assisted). Key information (from the funStuffs README):

- Overview: repository for small, focused projects generated and maintained with Codex + OpenClaw assistance. Local-first, modular, and documented.
- Current subprojects include:
  - todo/ — simple CLI todo app (usage: python -m todo add "Buy milk"). Data file: ~/.local/share/funstuff/todos.json
  - experiments/ — experiments in retrieval & summarization (e.g., experiments/topic_summarizer.py which demonstrates local qmd retrieval + OpenAI summarization)
  - web/ — tiny web demos (Flask/Static)
  - tools/ — small CLI utilities (git helpers, data cleaners)
